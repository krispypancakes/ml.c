# ml.c
For fun, educational purposes and self-torture, I'm going to implement simple ML stuff in C. 
First is obviously MNIST. Let's see if I will continue afterwards.
An idea would also be to switch to C++ add cuda support.

### Roadmap:
- Mnist dataloader - check
- simple MLP nn architecture:
    - neurons, activations
    - forward pass
    - backward pass
    - training loop
    - monitoring / plotting the loss
    - evaluation
- Add Conv layers
- Run on Arduino ?

- [Facial recognition]
    - deploy on Arduino
